# macbook

I'm using a MacBook that runs MacOS Sequoia on an Apple M1 chip

The chip is significant for many reasons

One reason the chip is significant is that... if I want to write assembly, I have to write ARM64 assembly

The chip has an ARM64 architecture

I have an older MacBook in storage that has an Intel chip

My older MacBook has an x86-64 architecture

I used to write x86 assembly on my older MacBook

Now I write arm64 assembly on my new MacBook

I want to say a few things about my MacBook... and about MacBooks in general...

First, there's a menu bar

I just figured this out today

I was so happy to figure it out, that I thought I would share my discovery

The menu bar runs along the top of the screen

In the top left corner, there is an Apple menu, represented by the Apple icon

To the right of the Apple icon, on the left side of the menu bar, there is an app menu

I am currently using Terminal, so the app menu shows the menu defined by the Terminal application

On the right side of the menu bar, there is a series of status menus

The status menus are typically represented by icons

The one exception to this rule is the notification center, which we can bring up by clicking on the Day and Time menu at the top right of the menu bar

To the left of the Day and Time menu, I have an icon representing Siri

I can click on the Siri icon to ask Siri a question

To the left of the Siri icon, there is an icon that represents the Control Center

I can click on this icon to bring up the Control Center

There are more icons in addition to these

There is an icon for Spotlight Search

There is a battery icon

There is an icon representing my keyboard input source

(I use this icon to switch between keyboards)

There is an icon that shows the current song that is playing

There is an icon that shows the available Wi-Fi networks, and which Wi-Fi network I am connected to

There is an icon that represents the Screen Mirroring feature

Sometimes I use the Screen Mirroring feature to display my MacBook screen on my TV

So you see... these status menus are really useful

The menu bar is really useful

The menu bar consists of all the menus that run along the top of the screen, including, the Apple menu, the app menu, the status menus, and the Day and Time reading

The menu bar consists of all the menus and icons that run along the top of the screen

If I move my cursor to the bottom of the screen, using the trackpad, the Dock appears

I have many applications in my Dock

I have been using MacBooks for a long time, and it is very helpful to know about the menu bar at the top of the screen, and the dock that appears on the bottom of the screen when you move your cursor to the bottom of the screen

It's helpful to know about the menu bar

It's helpful to know about the Dock

It's also really helpful to know about Terminal and vi

I use Terminal and vi to write documents (text files, HTML files, Markdown files, etc)

I use Terminal and vi to program (Python files, Java files, C/C++ files, HTML files, JavaScript files, and CSS files)

So I really use Terminal and vi to develop software and to author documents

I also use the menu bar at the top of the screen, and the Dock on the bottom

If I ever need to use the Finder application, I can find it in my Dock

I can also find Terminal in my Dock

One reason I use MacBooks is because I really like Terminal and vi

I use Terminal and vi to develop software and to author documents

I use Terminal and vi to write source code and to write documents

I think this is a good stopping point

I wrote this document because I wanted to share the following features that are available on a MacBook:
- The menu bar at the top of the screen (which consists of menus and icons)
- The dock at the bottom of the screen (Finder and Terminal are both part of my dock)
- Terminal (the command processor GUI that uses bash or zsh behind the scenes)
- vi/vim (a text editor that can be used in Terminal)

Today is Wednesday, September 24, 2025

I might put on a movie and relax

Thanks for reading,

P.S. In this document, I used the word "cursor" to refer to the trackpad pointer. It can also be called a "pointer"
