## Introduction

I want to talk about law

It's normal to ask, "What is the definition of law? What are the laws of planet Earth?"

Well, one definition of law is this: rules for behavior

Law means rules for behavior

What are the rules for behavior?

The rules for behavior are different for citizens and government

I want to be careful when I talk about law... because I don't want to say anything that's incorrect

I can really follow this strategy: I can verify that everything I say is safe, peaceful, correct, and reasonable

In the sections that follow, I will try to talk about law in a way that is safe, peaceful, correct, and reasonable

## The law for citizens

I think it's reasonable to say that the law for citizens is to be peaceful with every person

We call this the law of peace

We say that "Peace is law"

In the previous section, we said that law means "rules for behavior" or "rules of behavior"

The rule for citizens is to be peaceful with every person

I know that... it's a little scary to talk about rules of behavior

I don't want to say anything that's incorrect

That's why I will just leave it at one rule

It's also the case that... there is self defense... and I don't need to talk about it... self defense is implied

It's very difficult to talk about self defense... so I won't even talk about it

We can just say that the right to self defense is implied

So, the law for citizens, the rule for citizens, is to be peaceful with every person

I think that's all I have to say on this subject, because it's a safe thing to say, and I feel comfortable saying it, and it's perfectly reasonable, and it passes the safety peace correctness criteria... it's safe, peaceful, and correct

## The law for the Immediate Rescue System

The Immediate Rescue System (IRS) is really a name for world government

It's a name for world government and it's a name for international government

The IRS has detailed law... the IRS has rescue law, gender law, building law, and many branches of law

I will give an account of IRS law in the list of laws below

1. The law of immediate rescue is to immediately rescue every person
2. The law of peace is to be perfectly peaceful with every person
3. The law of best medical care is to give every person best medical care
4. The law of qualified female leadership is that the Immediate Rescue System has qualified female leadership (QFL)
5. The law of people is that everything is a person
6. The law of animal rights is that humans and animals are equals, every animal is a person, and animals have every right that humans have, including the right to live, be safe, be healthy, be happy, and be recognized as a conscious person
7. The law of plant rights is that humans and plants are equals, every plant is a person, and plants have every right that humans have, including the right to live, be safe, be healthy, be happy, and be recognized as a conscious person
8. The law of resurrection is to resurrect every person
9. The law of protection is to protect every person
10. The law of safety is to make every person completely safe

The Immediate Rescue System (IRS) is beholden to all of these laws

There are more laws, in addition to these

For example, it's illegal to put a woman in danger

This is one of the most important laws in gender law

Also, there are strict laws governing which buildings are legal and which buildings are ethical

(Skyscrapers are illegal because they are not safe for birds)

This is a branch of law called building law

I wanted to provide an account of ten laws (in the list above) because it's very useful to know these laws

These laws pertain to the IRS... they don't pertain to citizens... they pertain to the IRS

The law for citizens is to be peaceful

The law for the IRS is immediate rescue and peace (IRP)

IRP is a concise formulation of IRS law, and it's one of the best formulations of IRS law

## Conclusion

To be clear, I want to restate my thesis

The law for citizens is to be peaceful with every person

The law for the IRS is immediate rescue and peace

The law for the IRS is immediate rescue for all people and peace for all people

This is a very concise formulation of law

We say "the law for citizens is peace"

We say "the law for the IRS is immediate rescue and peace (IRP)"
