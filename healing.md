## Chapter one

It is important to know that the body can heal from anything

Best medical care is the cure for everything

In the past, I had irrational fears about health, and my fears made me depressed

My family taught me that best medical care cures everything

I am writing this document, because this knowledge really helped me, and I thought it might help others

It's good for everyone's mental health to know that best medical care cures everything

## Chapter two

The people we love, the things we love, are with us forever, and they cannot be stolen from us

They are in our DNA

Our DNA is a place for safe keeping, where we store the identities of our loved ones, the personalities of our loved ones, our hobbies, our values, our religion and our faith

The people we love, the things we love, are with us forever

They are stored safely in our genetic code

They are stored safely in our soul

## Chapter three

DNA is dynamic, and I hope that this fact makes things more clear

DNA is partly static and partly dynamic

Everyone has a static identifier in their DNA that identifies who they are

DNA changes over time, when we form new relationships, new values, and new commitments

## Chapter four

Best medical care is the cure for everything

Genetics is part of best medical care

It is really healing to know that the body can heal from anything

It is really healing to know about genetics
