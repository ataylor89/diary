# models of education

What is a model?

The word "model" is very useful, and we can give it many definitions

A model is a system; a model is a pattern

A model is a system that we can use to explain things and predict things

A model is a concrete representation of something abstract

(ICYW I defined the words "system" and "pattern" in the document mathematics_vocabulary.md)

Having given the word "model" some definitions, let's use it in a sentence

There are many models for predicting the weather

There are many models of education

At this point we can say, "Eureka", which means, "I have found it"

We discovered the phrase that really is the subject of this document

It's the subject of this document... and it also inspired this document...

There are many models of education

I really like this phrase/poem

Now, what are the different models of education?

Honestly, I have to think about it

I would say, for starters, that, there are many models of education

If I share one model of education, it's important to know, it's not the only model of education

I would like to talk about a specific model of education that I learned about recently

My family taught me this model of education

It's called "the book model of education"

Instead of thinking about education as a set of different subjects (math, physics, chemistry, biology, english, spanish, french, greek, latin, history, social studies, computer science, music, art, gym, phys ed, etc)...

We can actually think of education as a list of books

If I were to recommend a list of books, what would I recommend?

I'm a little shy because, if I don't include someone's book, I'm a little afraid of hurting their feelings

But, I want to share my recommendations, nonetheless

So, we can start with a very short list of recommendations

Here is my short list of recommendations

1. My family writing (that which is available to the general public, on sites like this, Github)
    - My family writing means the world to me
2. The Holy Bible
    - The Bible is really the book that saved me... because, it completely transformed me, and it made me happy
3. The Art of Problem Solving mathematical textbooks
    - I'm a mathematician by profession and the AoPS books are one of the best public curriculums for mathematics
4. The Art and Craft of Problem Solving by Paul Zeitz
    - I discovered this book in high school and it's just as instructive as the AoPS books
5. Mikhail Tal's My Life and Games
    - I used to sit on the carpeted floor of my bedroom, with a chess board set up in front of me, reading through the pages of this book
6. Bobby Fischer's My 60 Memorable Games
    - I would also read this book on my carpeted floor, with a chess board set up in front of me
7. Vladimir Kramnik's My Life and Games
    - I read this book in college when I was lonely, and it helped dispel my loneliness
8. Yasser Seirawan's collected works, including, Winning Chess Tactics and Winning Chess Strategies
    - I have been reading Yasser Seirawan's books since 8th grade or 9th grade, and I have learned so much from him
9. Endgame Workshop by Bruce Pandolfini
    - I read this book in college, and it made me a lot more confident in playing endgames
10. The Bhagavad Gita (a sacred Hindu text)
    - I actually read this book in 2024, and I loved it... I love the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna
11. The Analects (a sacred Confucian text)
    - I also read this book in 2024, and I loved it... it gave me a lot of insight into Confucianism
12. Plato's Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo
    - I care about Socrates so much, and these books tell the life story of Socrates
13. Plato's Republic
    - I care about Socrates very deeply, and this book adds to the life story of Socrates
14. From Alpha to Omega by Anne Groton
    - I read this book in 2016 and 2017 because I wanted to learn Ancient Greek
15. The First Hebrew Primer (by Simon, Resnikoff, and Motzkin)
    - I read this book in 2017 because I wanted to learn Biblical Hebrew
16. Ovid's Metamorphoses
    - I read this book in 2016 or 2017 because I wanted to learn about Greek and Roman gods
17. The Collected Works of William Shakespeare
    - Some of my favorite plays are Hamlet, King Lear, and Antony and Cleopatra
    - One of my long-term projects is to read more of Shakespeare's plays
    - One reason I treasure Shakespeare's writing is that it teaches me iambic pentameter and it also teaches me the sonnet form of poetry
18. British Romantic poetry
    - John Keats is one of my favorite poets
    - I love the poems "On first looking into Chapman's Homer", "Ode to a Grecian Urn", and "Ode to a Nightingale"
19. Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy
    - This is a very long novel, but I'm glad I read it, because I really love the characters
20. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
    - This novel is a lot shorter than Anna Karenina, and once again, I'm really glad I read it, because I love the characters
21. Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis
    - I'm a devout Christian and I treasure this book by C.S. Lewis
22. Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling
    - I became an orphan in high school and I really identified with Harry Potter
23. Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card
    - I love the book, I love the movie, and I love the soundtrack
    - I really love Ender's compassion, his strength of will, his ability to feel guilt and remorse, and his protectiveness of everyone
24. Wheelock's Latin (Wheelock and LaFleur) and Learn to Read Latin (Keller and Russell)
    - I have a passion for Latin, just like I have a passion for math, and I often turn to these books when I need to look something up
25. Thirty-Eight Latin Stories (by Anne Groton and James May) and 46 Stories in Classical Greek (by Anne Groton and James May)
    - I actually have not read these books, but I would like to, when I have time

When all is said and done, I am compelled to say, the list is a bit longer than I thought it would be

I would also like to say... there's more than one possible list of books

There are countless curricula for education, and this is just one of them

There are countless lists of books, and this is just one of them

I thought I would share a list of books that means a lot to me

The list of books (above) is a really big part of my education

There is more to my education, like, learning how to cook, learning how to brush my teeth, learning about safe habits

But the list of books (above) is a really big part of my education

Now, let's be honest, let's be real, let's be candid, let's be straightforward

It could take you ten years to read all of these books

I'm not suggesting you put everything aside and spend ten years reading these books

But it's possible that there's one book in this list of books that catches your eye

If you ask, "Andrew, I want three books to read, or three series of books. What do you recommend?"

Then I would say, "My family writing, The Holy Bible, and the Art of Problem Solving math books"

Now, I would like to wrap things up, and conclude this document

There are many models of education

We can think of education as a set of subjects (math, physics, chemistry, biology, history, social studies, english, spanish, french, latin, greek, computer science, music, art, phys ed, etc)

We can also think of education as a list of books

When we think of education as a list of books, we call it the "book model" of education

I think that the book model of education is very useful

If you were to give a student three books, or five books, or ten books, or twenty five books, which books would you include?

Which books would you include, and why?
