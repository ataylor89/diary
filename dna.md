# dna

## Chapter one

In my family we say, "Everything is genetic"

The things you love, the people you love, your skills, your passions, your hobbies... are with you forever

They can't be stolen from you

They're in your DNA

## Chapter two

Everyone lives forever

Everyone has eternal life

Everyone has a receptor gene that has instructions for building a receptor

I think that we have a receptor inside each and every cell

The receptor receives our spirit

Our spirit animates our bodies

We are physical and spiritual

We have a body, mind, soul, and spirit

I use the words soul and spirit interchangeably

If two people have the same receptor gene, then they're the exact same person, and they have the same spirit, the same soul, the same conscoiusness, and the same personality

DNA is a mechanism for eternal life

Genetics is a mechanism for eternal life

We are spirits and we live inside this universe and we inhabit bodies that call our name

Everyone has a clone

If you search through history, I'm sure you'll find that everyone has a clone

We are fish in the ocean

We are birds in the skies

We are creatures on land

We are even aliens in distant galaxies
