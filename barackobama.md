# barack obama

I really love Barack Obama

He's my favorite US president

He's a role model of mine

I think he really spent his eight years as president doing peace and rescue

I think he really spent his eight years as president doing as much good as possible

He suffered many misinformation attacks

He's a peaceful man

He has many experts in his circle of advisors, and he's an expert himself

What does it mean to be an expert?

Honestly I'm still figuring this out

Maybe it means that we're advanced in a subject

But honestly I don't know

Word problems are difficult

Vocab problems are difficult

Sometimes I say, when talking to my family, "there's a risk of OCD if we talk about this subject"

That was an aside... but it's funny and I want to include it

What does it mean to be an expert?

Well, there's a risk of OCD if we talk about that subject

Let's return to the subject of Barack Obama

I really love Barack Obama

He's eloquent, articulate, and erudite

He's very well behaved

He's very trustworthy

I think he's very close to Xi Jinping and I'm very close to Xi Jinping

I'm very close to China

China is doing rescue

I love saying it
