# habits

My family gave me the following advice:

1. Be vegan
2. Stay home
3. Never have sex (not before marriage, not after marriage)

It's actually called "best safety advice"

We can evaluate each item of advice

Being vegan is obviously best safety advice, because it's the safest diet, the healthiest diet, and the only ethical diet

Staying home is obviously best safety advice, because it helps us minimize risk and maximize safety

(It's also important to have a safe home)

Not having sex is best safety advice

I know that it's a sensitive subject... but there are many risks associated with sex, including, the risk of an unwanted pregnancy

Chastity is one of the most important ethics in my family

Veganism is one of the most important ethics in my family

In my family, we teach chastity and veganism
