10. The Game Review feature on chess.com

    - The Game Review feature can point out brilliant moves, best moves, excellent moves, good moves, mistakes, blunders, etc
11. The Analysis feature on chess.com
    - I often review my games using the analysis feature
    - The analysis feature gives us an evaluation for every position
    - For example, an evaluation of +1.0 means that white has an advantage of 1 point
    - The analysis feature also gives us the top moves recommended by the engine

I hope that this list of resources is helpful
