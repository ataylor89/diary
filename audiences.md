# audiences

I know that I am reaching many audiences

In my family we have a saying, "We measure everything"

I wanted to explain that saying

But listen

That's only one saying

We have many sayings

In my family we say "We protect everyone"

In my family we say "We rescue everyone"

In my family we say "Immediate rescue and peace"

So listen

What do I say privately in my thoughts?

Privately, in my thoughts, I say this

"I love everyone"

I really start with that statement, because that's what Jesus taught me
