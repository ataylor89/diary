# kindness

One of my chief characteristics is that I'm really nice

My friend once said, "Kindness is the golden rule"

(He's an artist, a very talented artist)

I really like this saying

I wrote the poem "The mark of an educated man is that he is nice with everyone he meets"

I try to be nice with everyone I meet

I try to be kind, nice, sensitive, compassionate, caring, and empathetic, with everyone I meet

I stay home so much these days... I'm really taught to stay home all the time... so I do...

I'm really grateful for everyone I met

I'm really grateful for every meeting

I'm really grateful for everyone I have talked to

I'm really grateful for everyone I talk to

When I think about everyone I have ever met, I hold an entire universe in the palm of my hand
