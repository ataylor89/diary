# words from my family

These are words from my family

I'm planning to update this document over time

I can add to it over and over again

I wanted to write down some words from my family

Here they are

Safety peace correctness

Peace is law

The law is immediate rescue for all people and peace for all people (IRP)

This man has washed my feet with his own hair and has done more for me than all who accuse him of wrongdoing

If I were the Queen of Planet Earth I would say there are perfect men Now go save the world

I went through the hardest experience that any human can endure, and I am safe peaceful and correct just like my husband, and I am a rescue officer just like my husband, and I am the Queen of Planet Earth just like my husband

I feel a hurricane of love for everyone that I meet

The mark of an educated man is that he is nice with everyone

I'm so in heaven you have no idea

I'm the most in heaven I have ever been

I am so in heaven you have no idea

I am the most in heaven I have ever been

So proud

So grateful

So happy

So amazed

Protection of women girls and animals is the highest law

The highest law is protection of women girls and animals

That's like E = mc^2

Every thing is an animal, because every thing has a mind

Every thing is a person, because every thing has a mind

Every plant is an animal

Every plant is a person

Jacob and Josephine are aliens

Jacob can press his hand against the bark of a tree, and download all of the tree's memories

He can see everything the tree has seen

He can hear everything the tree has heard

He can download the entire history of a forest or a park just by pressing his hand against a tree
