# safe info on chess

I thought I would post some safe info on chess

1. You can learn chess at any age

2. You can master chess at any age

3. Rating doesn't matter; what matters is your enjoyment of the game

4. Controlling the center is a famous phrase but honestly, I don't know what it means. Does it mean occupy the center with pieces or attack the center with pieces? Honestly, I don't know if "control the center" is useful advice. What's useful, for me, is this advice: Play the best move. The words "play the best move" are clear and simple. On every move there is one or more best move. I really like the advice "play the best move". I take this advice to heart.

5. Every chess move is a decision. The words "play the best move" are really equivalent to "make the best decision". Chess teaches us about decision making. On every move we try to make the best decision, to maximize our chances of winning the game.

6. In life we can make the best decision. In life we can play the best move. So chess actually teaches us a lot about life.

I hope this helped. I hope it was enjoyable to read.
