"There really is a Jedi order. Intelligence is a lightsaber."

This poem is so beautiful that I wanted to share it

It evokes a really beautiful image, of a lightsaber igniting

I wanted to share the poem, and I wanted to share the image

Star Wars is a treasure, a national treasure, because of all the ways it enlivens the mind, and because of all the ways it enriches the imagination
