This is the start of my Github diary

It's so interesting... what should my first post be about?

What should my first diary entry be about?

Listen

I can't stop listening to this song

Maybe that's what my first post should be about

I'm a huge fan of Hans Zimmer's music

I listen to the music of Hans Zimmer, Steve Jablonsky, Ramin Djawadi, John Williams, and Sigur Ros

I listen to a lot of music, but those are some of my favorite composers and bands

So I've been listening to this version of Interstellar, the version in the link I included above

It's the version by Imperial Orchestra

I've been listening to the music of Hans Zimmer lately

Hans Zimmer is really the Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach of the 21st century

One day a boy walked into a pasture and found a cow

The cow asked him if he could sit down with her

He said, "I would be happy to sit down with you"

They lay down together in the pasture

"I have so many questions to ask you," said the cow

The boy felt tears spring to his eyes

"I can try my best to answer them," he said

"I know you're very good at math," said the cow, "so perhaps you can help me analyze the world"

The boy felt tears fall from his eyes

The cow and the boy were lying down together in the pasture

It was morning, and there was a clear blue sky overhead

He could see the sun in the sky, above the horizon

There were trees in the distance

The trees were watching them

It was just the cow, the boy, and a row of trees in the distance

There was also a house beside them and it belonged to the cow

"You can live with me," the cow said to the boy

The boy was very emotional at these words

"I would love to," said the boy
