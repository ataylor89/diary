# equally smart

In my family we say, "Everyone in our family is equally smart"

In my family we say, "Everyone in our family is equally mature"

Now, can I say this about everyone in the world?

It's an interesting question

What does the word "smart" mean? What does the word "mature" mean?

Honestly, I might not know how to talk about this subject

I use these words, in my writing, because I like to use every color in my palette, every word that's appropriate to use
