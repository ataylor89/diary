# the refutation of democracy

## Chapter one

We can refute democracy in just a single statement

"Democracy is not safe for women, and this is one proof that democracy is wrong"

Democracy is a wrong form of government

Democracy is a wrong model of leadership

What is the right form of government?

What is the right model of leadership?

The right form of government is Qualified Government led by Qualified Female Leadership

The right model of leadership is Qualified Female Leadership

So I'll just end this by saying...

We refuted democracy

The refutation is simple

Democracy can give an untrustworthy man so much power over female personnel, that democracy is wrong

Democracy is not safe for women, and this is one proof that democracy is wrong

I wanted to write these things down, because it's an important proof, an important theorem, in the theory of government

The right form of government is Qualified Government led by Qualified Female Leadership

The right model of leadership is Qualified Female Leadership

## Chapter two

If you read Plato's writing (dialogues like Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic), you'll see that Plato refuted democracy over two thousand years ago, before the birth of Jesus Christ

So listen

I'm not the first person to refute democracy

Plato refuted democracy

Jesus refuted democracy

There are many brilliant intellectuals between me and Jesus, me and Plato, who refuted democracy

I am one of many people who has refuted democracy

Plato did it over two thousand years ago

And listen

He did something more important than this

Plato made Socrates immortal

Plato made Socrates one of my best friends

And this is one of the best things he did with his writing
