# the refutation of democracy

We can refute democracy in just a single statement

"Democracy is not safe for women, and this is one proof that democracy is wrong"

Democracy is a wrong form of government

Democracy is a wrong model of leadership

What is the right form of government?

What is the right model of leadership?

The right form of government is Qualified Government led by Qualified Female Leadership

The right model of leadership is Qualified Female Leadership

So I'll just end this by saying...

We refuted democracy

The refutation is simple

Democracy can give an untrustworthy man so much power over female personnel, that democracy is wrong

Democracy is not safe for women, and this is one proof that democracy is wrong

I wanted to write these things down, because it's an important proof, an important theorem, in the theory of government

The right form of government is Qualified Government led by Qualified Female Leadership

The right model of leadership is Qualified Female Leadership
