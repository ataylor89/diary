# the refutation of democracy

## Chapter one

We can refute democracy very quickly

"Democracy is not safe for women, and this is one proof that democracy is wrong"

Democracy is not the right form of government

Democracy is not the right model of leadership

## Chapter two

What is the right form of government?

What is the right model of leadership?

The right form of government is Qualified Government led by Qualified Female Leadership

The right model of leadership is Qualified Female Leadership

## Chapter three

We refuted democracy

The refutation is simple

Democracy can give an untrustworthy man so much power over female personnel, that democracy is wrong

Democracy is not safe for women, and this is one proof that democracy is wrong

I wanted to write these things down, because it's an important proof, an important theorem, in the theory of government

## Chapter four

If you read Plato's writing (dialogues like Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic), you'll see that Plato refuted democracy over two thousand years ago, before the birth of Jesus Christ

I am not the first person to refute democracy

Plato refuted democracy

There are many people who refuted democracy after Plato

Plato accomplished a lot of things with his writing

He shared Socrates with the world

He made Socrates a character in my imagination

He wrote down many accounts of Socrates, to share them with posterity

I'm really grateful that he did this

I'm really grateful for Plato

I'm really grateful for Socrates

Socrates has a special place in my imagination

Socrates is famous for saying that there are some things he knows and some things he doesn't know

I can say the same -- there are some things I know and some things I don't know

I know that Socrates earned a place in my heart forever

I know that Socrates earned a place in my mind forever

Socrates has a place in my imagination...

My imagination is part of my mind

So I can confidently say, "Socrates lives in my heart and mind"

I can confidently say, "Socrates is a philosopher who taught me philosophy"

Philosophy is the love of wisdom

What is wisdom?

That's a really good question for a philosopher

If philosophy is the love of wisdom, then what is wisdom?

I'll leave that for you to decide

## Chapter five

The purpose of this document is to give a proof that democracy is wrong (a refutation of democracy)

Democracy is not a good system for choosing a leader

It is important to recognize the true leaders of planet Earth

The true leaders of planet Earth are Qualified Female Leadership

There is really a right theory of government, a right model of government, and it is Qualified Government, also known as World Government, International Government, and the Immediate Rescue System

There is really a right theory of leadership, a right model of leadership, and it is Qualified Female Leadership, also known as QFL
