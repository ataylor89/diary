Africa is such a special place, because there's really a theory that every monkey comes from Africa

I'm a monkey

I'm also an ant, a fly, a cow, a pig, a chicken

I'm also a dog and a cat

I'm every species

Listen

I'll share with you another theory

There's a theory that fire was discovered in Africa

Fire changed everything

Daenerys changed everything

Daenerys said "Dracarys"

A long, long, long time ago, a woman named Daenerys grew up in Africa

And she said "Dracarys"

And then there was light

She was able to light the darkest room

She was able to light the darkest sky

Her name is Daenerys, and she grew up in Africa
