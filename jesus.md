I look up to Jesus of Nazareth

He is one of my best teachers

He taught me to open my heart, and love everyone

He taught me humility

He taught me forgiveness

He taught me to worship the people who have suffered the most

He taught me to care for the people who have suffered the most

He taught me to care for everyone

Jesus is portrayed in the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John)

The Gospels are some of my favorite texts

I also have a soft spot for Isaiah

Here is a passage that I really like in Isaiah

4 The Sovereign Lord has given me a well-instructed tongue,  
    to know the word that sustains the weary.  
He wakens me morning by morning,  
    wakens my ear to listen like one being instructed.  
5 The Sovereign Lord has opened my ears;  
    I have not been rebellious,  
    I have not turned away.  
6 I offered my back to those who beat me,  
    my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard;  
I did not hide my face  
    from mocking and spitting.  
7 Because the Sovereign Lord helps me,  
    I will not be disgraced.  
Therefore have I set my face like flint,  
    and I know I will not be put to shame.

(Isaiah 50:4-7 NIV)

The Holy Bible is kind of like my handbook for good behavior

There are plenty of mistakes in the Bible

But I learn by reading the Gospels, and I learn by reading specific passages, like Isaiah 50:4-7

I learn by reading the story of Jesus of Nazareth

I feel very close to the Vatican, and I am very grateful for the Vatican, because the Vatican safeguards Jesus, Mary, and Joseph

I'll just say that...

Jesus taught me to open my heart, and love everyone

This is why the Bible is so important to me
